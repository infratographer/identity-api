# identity-api

identity-api is an OAuth service that supports the following grant types:

* Token Exchange: [RFC 8693][rfc8693]
* Client Credentials: [RFC 6749][oauth2-client_credentials]

[rfc8693]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8693.html
[oauth2-client_credentials]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-4.4

## Usage

identity-api is a Go service. To build it, you can either use `make build` to build a Go binary or `make up` to both build and start the service.

The `up` Makefile target will auto-generate a private key and mount it in the container for testing purposes. Note that this is not recommended for actual production use, and is merely a handy feature to allow developers to test.

### Exchanging tokens

To perform a token exchange, [seed your database](#seeding-the-database-with-a-trusted-issuer) with a trusted issuer. Then, try running the following:

```
$ read -s -p 'Enter your token: ' AUTH_TOKEN && echo
$ curl -XPOST -d "grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange&subject_token=$AUTH_TOKEN&subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt" http://localhost:8000/token | jq
```

This sends an RFC 8693 token exchange request to identity-api, which then will validate the given subject token against the configured subject token issuers. If the token is valid, you will receive a response like so (access token truncated for brevity):

```
{
  "access_token": "eyJ..VwM",
  "expires_in": 100,
  "token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt"
}
```

To examine the payload of the access token JWT itself, you can use [jq][jq] to decode the payload:

```
$ echo "$ACCESS_TOKEN" | jq '.access_token | split(".") | .[1] | @base64d | fromjson'
{
  "aud": [],
  "client_id": "my-client",
  "exp": 1670354213,
  "iat": 1670354113,
  "iss": "https://iam.infratographer.com/",
  "jti": "e36322d3-414c-4da2-91a8-f19a6e9fb1d3",
  "scp": [],
  "sub": "my-user-id"
}
```

### JWKS

The [JSON Web Key Set][jwks] (JWKS) used for signing identity-api JWTs is available at `/jwks.json`.

[jwks]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7517.html#section-5

### Configuration

identity-api requires a configuration file to run. An example can be found at `identity-api.example.yaml`.

Private keys must be explicitly configured with a JWT signing algorithm, such as HS256 or RS256. Symmetric keys are loaded from key files as raw bytes. All asymmetric (i.e., RSA) signing keys must be encoded using [PKCS #8][pkcs8]. To generate an RSA private key for development, the following command should get you started:

```
$ openssl genpkey -out privkey.pem -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
```

Update the config file and/or Docker Compose volume mounts accordingly.

If the permissions config has been defined, the actor will need access to the following actions to make the corresponding api calls. See [Permissions-API][permissionsapi] for more details on updating your policy.

* iam_issuer_create
* iam_issuer_update
* iam_issuer_delete
* iam_issuer_get
* iam_oauthclient_create
* iam_oauthclient_delete
* iam_oauthclient_get
* iam_user_get

## Development

identity-api includes a [dev container][dev-container] for facilitating service development. Using the dev container is not required, but provides a consistent environment for all contributors as well as a few perks like:

* [gopls][gopls] integration out of the box
* Host SSH auth socket mount
* Git support

To get started, you can use either [VS Code][vs-code] or the official [CLI][cli].

[dev-container]: https://containers.dev/
[gopls]: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls
[vs-code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers
[cli]: https://github.com/devcontainers/cli

### Seeding the database with a trusted issuer

In order to complete a token exchange, you will need to have an issuer configured in your database. An example seed exists in this repository and a tool exists for loading that data into the local database.

```sh
go run main.go seed-database --config identity-api.example.yaml --data data.example.yaml
```

### Manually setting up SSH agent forwarding

The provided dev container listens for SSH connections on port 2222 and bind mounts `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` from the host to facilitate SSH. In order to perform Git operations (i.e., committing code in the container), you will need to enable SSH agent forwarding from your machine to the dev container. While VS Code handles this automatically, for other editors you will need to set this up manually.

To do so, update your `~/.ssh/config` to support agent forwarding. The following config snippet should accomplish this for you:

```
Host identity-api-devcontainer
  ProxyJump YOUR_HOST_HERE
  Port 2222
  User vscode
  ForwardAgent yes

Host YOUR_HOST_HERE
  User YOUR_USER_HERE
  ForwardAgent yes
```

See the man page for `ssh_config` for more information on what these options do.
